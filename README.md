# News
[2024/11/9] We build the reading list to continuously collect advanced work about tool-use agent (as known as tool learning with foundation models). 


# Advanced Method

1. [2024/06] ToolPrefer-LLaMA: A framework for offline extraction of step-by-step preference data from decision trees to effectively utilize failed explorations by direct preference optimization (Nanjing University, Alibaba Group)[[paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07115)]
2. [2024/10] ToolPlanner: A two-stage reinforcement learning framework that utilizes path planning and two feedback mechanisms to enhance the LLMâ€™s tool use capabilities (XiaoMi AI Lab)[[paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14826)]
3. [2024/10] StepTool: A step-grained RL framework with reward shaping and policy gradient optimization for tool learning in LLMs (Tsinghua University, Huawei Noah's Ark Lab)[[paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07745)]
